        Hi, my name is Ge Su. I am a IT student studying in Deakin University. I also study Full-Stack web developer coding bootcamp at University of Adelaide. I have great passion about technology and coding. In my spare time, I like to go to gym and learn belly dancing. I enjoy going out with friends for hiking during the weekends.
